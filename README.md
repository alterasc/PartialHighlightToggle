# Partial Highlight Toggle mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

### Requires Mod Menu

Allows toggling of partial highlight mode that highlights only loot and interactable map objects, without highlighting everything else.    
To highlight the rest press your highlight key as normal.    
Partial highlight is temporarily disabled for dialogue, cutscene and combat. And is returned to the state it was before after dialogue/cutscene/combat end.


### Entries in Mod Menu settings

Toggle partial object highlight - default: Ctrl+R
Highlights loot and interactable map objects

Partial highlighting default state - default: Off
Off = game starts with partial highlight disabled and you need to enable it. On = load in the game with partial highligh on.


Do NOT use this together with Toybox "Object Highlight Toggle Mode" option. Either use this mod or use Toybox toggle.
